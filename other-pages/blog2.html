        <p> 
            While writing content in the HTML, we often come across cases where we have to use bold fonts. Reasons for using bold texts can be different. Most of the times, we just want to draw attention of the users. Sometimes, the text itself has more importance that the surrounding text and therefore, we need to make it bold. 
        </p>

        <h2> Using &lt;strong&gt; tag </h2>
        <p> 
            The bolded text has more importance than the surrounding text. For exmaple, "This text is &lt;strong&gt; important &lt;/strong&gt; ! And this text is not important. "
        </p>

        <h2> Using &lt;b&gt; tag </h2>
        <p> 
            Use &lt;b&gt; tag when you just want to draw the user's attention, or to make the text appear logically different or aesthctically pleasing.            
        </p>
