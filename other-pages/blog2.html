        <h1> Difference between &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt; tags in HTML </h1>

        <p>
            In our daily lives, we often come across two words: Strong and Bold, they both have different meanings.
            Strong is something that can produce or withstand great physical force while bold is daring or courageous.
            In HTML also these words exist as tags and yes, they have different meanings.
        </p>

        <p>
            While writing content in HTML, many times we have to use bold fonts. Reasons for using bold texts can be
            different. Most of the times, we just want to draw attention of the users. Sometimes, the text itself has
            more importance than the surrounding text and therefore, we need to make it bold.

        </p>

        <h2> Using &lt;strong&gt; tag </h2>
        <p>
            The bolded text has more importance than the surrounding text.  <br> 
            For example, "This text is <strong> &lt; important &gt </strong> 
            ! And this text is not important. "   <br>
            This tag is used when certain text needs to be emphasized to make it
            stand out.
        </p>

        <h2> Using &lt;b&gt; tag </h2>
        <p>
            Use &lt;b&gt; tag when you just want to draw the user's attention, or to make the text appear logically
            different or aesthetically pleasing.
            This tag is used when text needs to be bolded for styling purpose only.
            
        </p>

        <p> 
            To conclude, for styling/presentaion &lt;b&gt; is your 'go-to' tag, for context (to the browser), &lt;strong&gt; is your tag. 
            Although both the above tags will give same results, under the hood they are different. It is not advisable to use them interchangeably because of their sematics. Using semantic tags is important for screen readers as these tags add meaning to the markup. As a result, search engines, screen readers and web browsers can make sense of it. To understand this, let us look at the example below: <br>
            If a user is using a text-to-speech program, then all the text is spoken to them. If &lt;strong&gt; tag is used, the text-to-speech program will speak with some emphasis on that word giving the user an idea that the word was important. But if a &lt;b&gt; tag is used, the text-to-speech program will not speak it differenly, and the user would never get a clue that the word was important. 
        
            In HTML, semantics is an important thing.
