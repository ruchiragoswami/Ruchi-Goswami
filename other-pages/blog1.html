            While working in a regular desktop environment using an operating system like Windows or MacOS one can get away with using any file names. For example, "Some File Name". 
        </p>

        <p> 
            In web development, server computers are utlized and the end users of any websites have to navigate to that website in their browsers. For this reason, the file naming conventions in web development are slightly strict.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In Web Development, file names usually follow these rules:
            <ol>
                <li> Use alpha-numeric characters only </li>
                <li> Use only lower-case characters </li>
                <li>To separate words, use "-" or "_". Don't use spaces, dots or slashes </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2> Other tips for naming files: </h2>
        <p> 
            <ul>
                <li> Not to make file names too long because these might be hard to remember down the road </li>
                <li> Avoid using special characters like ~  !  # $ % ^  & *</li>
                <li> The first character of the file name should be a letter </li>
                <li> Records can be moved from their original locations like copied to other fulders, downloaded or emailed. So, use descriptive file names </li>
                <li> If you are including dates in the file names, make sure the format is consistent. E.g. YYYY_MM_DD or DDMMYYYY </li>
                <li> Add a version number if there are drafts and revisions of the same document</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, being consistent throughout the project while naming files is important. There will be exceptions at times, and it is not possible to follow all the rules for file naming always.
