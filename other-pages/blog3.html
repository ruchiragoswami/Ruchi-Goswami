        <h1> Emotions at Workplace </h1>
        <p> <small> August 2021 </small></p>

        <p>
            Have you ever thought that how would the life be, if there were no emotions? <br>
            <b>  Life without emotions is like a
            tree without blossom and fruits. </b> Without emotions, life would be dull and void. Emotions can compel us to
            take actions and make decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Emotions affect attitudes and behaviour of human beings. Emotions in workplace direct how an organization
            communicates within itself and to the outside world. Emotions are states of feeling (as opposed to
            reasoning) and include feelings (fear, anger), physiological changes and the inclination to act. <br>

            Some of the emotions that we experience in daily life are joy, love, anger, fear, surprise, sadness.

        <p>
            Have you ever wondered why a cashier at grocery store is always smiling ? It’s the emotional labour!
            <strong>The effort needed to manage your emotions in order to perform your job effectively is called
                emotional labour. </strong> Emotional labour is a part of all human interactions and relationship and
            emotional labour involved in some jobs can be demanding. <br>

            Example, police, health care professional, or any other job that deals with general public, including
            teachers.

        </p>

        <p>
            The degree of an individual’s emotional labour (how much effort is needed to manage emotions) is directly
            related to emotional dissonance which refers to the contradiction between the emotions that are experienced
            and emotions that are expressed.
            Example is not showing anger toward a customer.
            People typically handle emotional labour by acting a part.

        </p>
        <p>
            Emotion is sometimes the driving force behind our attitudes and behavior. As such, emotion plays a major
            role in how other people influence us and can be the determining factor in attempts to persuade us to change
            our attitudes and behavior.

            Being able to not only control your emotions, but gauge the emotions of those around you and effectively
            influence them is imperative to success in the workplace.
